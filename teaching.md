### Teaching

My time at UChicago overlapped nicely with the creation of a new data science program. 
I was lucky to TA and help shape the undergraduate data science course sequence for most of my time in graduate school. 

I also designed and taught a data science course as part of the UChicago summer sessions for high school students.
