Hi! I'm Abby and I live in San Francisco. Iâ€™m broadly interested in making tools from statistics and machine learning more transparent, useful, and ethical, especially when deployed in domains with high social impact. I'm currently a research scientist in the Social and Behavioral Systems group at [Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov/profile/abby-stevens), where I develop statistical methods that make large-scale experimentation with complex mechanistic simulators, like climate and epidemiological models, more computationally feasible and accessible to decision-makers. 

I got a PhD in Statistics from [UChicago](https://stat.uchicago.edu/) in 2022, where I was advised by [Becca Willett](https://willett.psd.uchicago.edu/) and studied interpretability in machine learning methods. Before that, I worked for a few years as a data scientist at [Doximity](https://www.doximity.com/). I graduated with a math degree from [Grinnell College](https://www.grinnell.edu/academics/majors-concentrations/math-stats) in 2014. 

I had a great time organizing [Women in Data Science Chicago](https://widschicago.org/) during grad school, and have been involved in a number of data science for social good initiatives such as the
Data Science Working Group at [Code for San Francisco](https://www.codeforsanfrancisco.org/) and the 
[Center for Data Science and Public Policy](http://www.datasciencepublicpolicy.org/). 

I'm also very passionate about things like food and wine and traveling and hiking and reading and listening to music and hanging out, and I always have a new craft on rotation ([silver clay](https://www.artclay.co.jp/htm/products/what_is_artclaysilver.shtml), as of the latest update).
