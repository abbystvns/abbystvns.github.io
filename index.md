Hi! I'm Abby and I live in San Francisco.

I'm broadly interested in making tools from statistics and machine learning more transparent, useful, and ethical. I focus 
on problems with significant societal impact, such as climate change and public health. 

I received my PhD in Statistics from [UChicago](https://stat.uchicago.edu/) earlier this summer, advised by [Becca Willett](https://willett.psd.uchicago.edu/). 
Before that, I worked for a few years as a data scientist at [Doximity](https://www.doximity.com/).
I graduated with a math degree from [Grinnell College](https://www.grinnell.edu/academics/majors-concentrations/math-stats) in 2014. 

I had a great time organizing [Women in Data Science Chicago](https://widschicago.org/) during grad school, and 
have been involved in a number of data science for social good initiatives such as the
Data Science Working Group at [Code for San Francisco](https://www.codeforsanfrancisco.org/) and the 
[Center for Data Science and Public Policy](http://www.datasciencepublicpolicy.org/). Outside of this stuff, I love to travel, eat, drink wine, 
and do a bunch of weird crafts.
